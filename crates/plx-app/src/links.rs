//! Links between the analyses of a project, like the links between the cells of Ansys
//! Workbench's project schematic, but down to single items of the model tree: an analysis
//! takes the geometry, the mesh, its setup, a category of the setup or one item of it from
//! another analysis, which owns them. The results of a step of one analysis can drive a step
//! of another, the submodel.
//!
//! A path names what is linked, as the block of the analysis lists it: `["Geometry"]`,
//! `["Mesh"]`, `["Setup"]`, `["Setup", "Materials"]`, `["Setup", "Materials", "Steel"]` or
//! `["Results", "Step-1"]`.
//!
//! Links are of two kinds. A reference link makes a row of the target the same as the row
//! of the same path in the source: it goes from like to like, and the target cannot change
//! what it takes. An operation link gives what a step of the source produced, its results,
//! to a step of the target that uses it: it starts at a Results row, which only gives, and
//! ends at an input of a step under `["Setup", "Steps", step]`: its `"Temperatures"`, its
//! `"Eigenmodes"` or its `"Global results"` (see [`STEP_INPUTS`]), at the temperatures of
//! the initial conditions, or at the State row.
//!
//! A value link gives a number, a row `["Value", name]` of a Parameters block, to a
//! parameter of another block, `["Parameters", key]`, such as the length of a mesh block.
//! Like a reference, the parameter is then the same as the number and read-only.
//!
//! A state link, `["State", "Step-1"]`, makes the target continue the source: it takes the
//! source's model and its steps up to that step, then solves its own steps from the state
//! CalculiX wrote after it.
