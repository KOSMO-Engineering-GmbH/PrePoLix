//! Campbell diagram of a rotor: the complex eigenfrequencies over the rotational speed.
//!
//! PrePoMax has no such tool; CalculiX computes the whirling modes for one speed per run.
//! The sweep runs the analysis once per speed, scaling the centrifugal loads of the model,
//! reads the complex frequencies and the turning direction of every mode from the `.dat`
//! file and plots them over the speed, with the engine order lines (1x, 2x, ...) whose
//! crossings with the modes are the critical speeds.
//!
//! The sweep is adaptive: after a coarse grid over the speed range it keeps adding speeds
//! where the curves bend most, until it is stopped or reaches its number of runs. The modes
//! are followed from speed to speed by their course, not by their rank, so a spurious root
//! CalculiX finds at one speed does not shift every curve above it.
