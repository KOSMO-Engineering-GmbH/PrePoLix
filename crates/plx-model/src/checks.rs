//! Checks of the model before CalculiX runs, for the mistakes that most often make a run abort
//! or give useless results: parts that are not held, elements without a material, materials
//! without the constants a step needs, distorted elements, contradicting boundary conditions.
//! Each finding names the tree item it belongs to and explains the problem and its fix.
//!
//! The checks are derived from the model like [`crate::validity`]; the expensive part that
//! only depends on the mesh (connectivity and element distortion) is computed once in
//! [`MeshCheck`]. CalculiX's own error messages after a failed run are mapped to the same
//! explanations by [`diagnose_solver_output`].
