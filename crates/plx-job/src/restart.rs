//! Solving again from the last unchanged step: CalculiX writes the state after each step into
//! `<job>.rout` (`*RESTART, WRITE`), and a later run of the same job whose first steps did
//! not change reads it back (`*RESTART, READ, STEP=n`) and solves only the steps after.
//!
//! What a run solves is told apart by the text of its input file: the model definition as a
//! set of keyword blocks, and a fingerprint per step that includes the steps before it. A
//! restart is only taken when it gives the same results as the full run:
//!
//! * the model definition is the same; sets only the new run needs are not allowed, as
//!   CalculiX takes no model definition after `*RESTART, READ`;
//! * the steps up to the restart are the same, and CalculiX wrote their state;
//! * these steps are steps over time (static, dynamic, heat transfer, visco), whose state the
//!   following steps continue; perturbation steps such as a frequency step are solved again;
//! * the results of the steps up to the restart are still there, to be joined with the new
//!   ones into one `.frd` and `.dat` file, numbered as if CalculiX had solved all steps;
//! * the same CalculiX executable wrote the state, as the files depend on its version.
//!
//! Otherwise the job runs in full. The input file kept with the results is always the full
//! one, which runs without the state files.
