//! The dependent degrees of freedom of the input file, kept in one place so that the
//! constraints PrePoLix writes itself never bind the same one twice. CalculiX aborts when a
//! degree of freedom is the dependent one of an `*EQUATION` or `*RIGID BODY` and a boundary
//! condition holds it ("dependent side of a MPC and a SPC"), or when two of them depend on
//! it ("dependent side of two different MPC's"); `*TIE` skips such degrees of freedom by
//! itself (tried with CalculiX 2.21 and 2.23).
//!
//! The writer claims the degrees of freedom in the order of precedence: boundary conditions
//! and cyclic symmetry first, then rigid bodies and remote points, the user's own
//! constraints, then pre-tension cuts and node ties, last the equations of contact regions.
//! As Abaqus moves a boundary condition of a tie's dependent node to its independent nodes,
//! an equation whose dependent term is taken depends on another of its terms instead: a free
//! direction of the same node, else a node on the other side. An equation all of whose terms
//! are taken binds nothing new and is left out; so is a node of a rigid body that is taken.
//! What was changed is listed as comments at the top of the constraints, and the
//! application shows it in the solver output.
