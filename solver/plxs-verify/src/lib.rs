//! Verification of the PrePoLix solver against CalculiX: a corpus of fixtures (input files
//! PrePoLix's writer produces, plus the examples of `testdata/`) with golden result files
//! computed by CalculiX, and the comparison of what another solver computes for them.
//!
//! Layout (`solver/fixtures/<area>/`):
//!
//! - `<name>.inp`: the input, as PrePoLix writes it.
//! - `<name>.toml`: what the fixture tests ([`Meta`]): area, tolerance class, milestone,
//!   the keywords and element types it uses, and where it came from.
//! - `<name>.ref.frd.gz`: CalculiX's `.frd`, gzip-compressed (flate2 is pure Rust and in the
//!   workspace already; the concept named zstd, which needs a C library).
//! - `<name>.ref.dat`: CalculiX's `.dat`, when the input requests history output.
//!
//! Comparison works on what PrePoLix reads, not on text: both files go through
//! `plx_io::frd::read_frd_bytes` and `plx_io::dat::parse_dat`, then the meshes must match
//! exactly (class D: node and element ids, element types, expansion), the increments must
//! line up (step, increment, kind, value), and every raw component of every field must agree
//! within the tolerance of the fixture's class relative to the largest absolute value of the
//! component (see [`Class::tolerance`]).
//!
//! `cargo test -p plxs-verify` checks the corpus itself (every input parses with
//! `plxs-input`, every golden file decodes and matches itself, the feature matrix in
//! `docs/solver/FIXTURES.md` is current). Running a solver over the corpus is the
//! `plxs-fixtures` binary (`cargo run -p plxs-verify --bin plxs-fixtures -- run --solver
//! target/debug/plxs`) and, for the milestone threads, tests that call [`run_corpus`] on their
//! fixtures.
