//! The data model of the PrePoLix solver (`plxs`): the intermediate representation (IR) that
//! every other solver crate works on, and nothing else.
//!
//! The IR is the contract between the crates of `solver/`: `plxs-input` fills it from a
//! CalculiX input file, PrePoLix itself will fill it directly from its model in phase 2, and
//! the elements, constraints, contact, procedures and output crates read it. It holds **data,
//! validation and errors only**; no element matrix, no solver and no file format lives here.
//!
//! Rules (see `docs/solver/SCHNITTSTELLEN.md`):
//!
//! - User ids (node and element numbers of the input) stay; the solver computes on dense
//!   indices ([`Nodes::index`], [`Model::element_index`]) and writes the ids out again.
//! - Everything is `Clone + Serialize + Deserialize` so that models, states and results can be
//!   handed between nodes of the PrePoLix graph and stored for a restart.
//! - Names of sets, surfaces, materials, interactions and amplitudes are stored as CalculiX
//!   reads them: upper case ([`normalized_name`]).
//! - The IR covers the whole CalculiX inventory PrePoLix writes (concept section 1), also what
//!   is computed only in later milestones, so that the shape of the data does not change while
//!   the crates fill up. Changing it is a PR of its own.
//! - A step holds what is in force during it: the `OP=NEW` semantics of CalculiX are resolved
//!   by the reader, procedures never look at earlier steps.
//!
//! Sources: CalculiX CrunchiX user's manual 2.23 (keyword chapter) for the meaning of each
//! field. No CalculiX source code was consulted or translated (its licence, GPL-2.0-only, is not
//! compatible with this project's GPL-3.0-or-later).
