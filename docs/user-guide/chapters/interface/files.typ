=== What each file type does

/ `.plx` (PrePolix project): geometry, mesh setup, mesh and FE model in one file. Saving writes a
  temporary file first and then replaces the old one, so a crash during saving cannot destroy the
  project. A project written by a newer version of PrePolix is refused.
/ `.inp` (CalculiX input): *only the mesh* is imported: nodes, elements, `*NSET`, `*ELSET`
  (also `GENERATE`), `*SURFACE` and files referenced with `*INCLUDE`. Every element set named in
  `*ELEMENT, ELSET=...` becomes a part. All other keywords (materials, steps, ...) are skipped and
  listed in the output pane. The model space follows the element types: `CPS`, `CPE` and `CAX`
  elements give a 2D model.
/ `.frd` (CalculiX results): added to the results on the #ui("Results") tab; the FE model is not
  touched. Opening the same file again reloads it and keeps its hot spots, paths and planes. A
  `.dat` file with the same name next to it is read as well (history output).
/ CAD files: #menu("File", "Open ...") replaces the model with the geometry. To *add* geometry
  to an existing model use #menu("Geometry", "Import ...") (@geometry-import).

Supported element types of `.inp` meshes: `C3D4`, `C3D6`, `C3D8`, `C3D10`, `C3D15`, `C3D20` with
their `R` and `I` variants, `S3`, `S4`, `S6`, `S8`, `M3D` membranes, `CPS`/`CPE`/`CAX` plane and
axisymmetric elements, `B31`, `B32`, `T3D2` and `T3D3`.

=== Drag and drop and command line

Files can be dropped onto the window. Several CAD files dropped together are combined into one
geometry; otherwise only the first dropped file is opened.

On the command line, `prepolix model.plx results.frd` opens all files in order. Without files,
PrePolix reopens the last saved project that was open at exit.
