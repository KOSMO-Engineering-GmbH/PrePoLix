== The 3D view <view>

=== Mouse and keyboard

#table(
  columns: (auto, 1fr),
  stroke: (x, y) => if y == 0 { (bottom: 0.7pt) } else { (bottom: 0.3pt + luma(200)) },
  inset: (x: 5pt, y: 4pt),
  table.header([*Input*], [*Action*]),
  [Middle button drag], [Rotate about the point of the model under the cursor, marked by a
    red dot while turning; over empty space about the centre of the view],
  [#key("Shift") + middle button drag], [Pan],
  [Mouse wheel], [Zoom about the cursor, with #key("Ctrl") in finer steps],
  [#key("Ctrl") + middle button drag], [Zoom],
  [Double-click (left)], [Zoom to fit],
  [Left click on a part], [Select the part in the tree; #key("Ctrl") toggles, #key("Shift")
    adds. On the #ui("FE Model") tab the tree marks what acts on the part (@acting).
    A click into empty space clears the selection.],
  [Left drag], [Box selection, only while a dialog is picking (@selection)],
  [Right click], [Context menu: the menu of the part under the cursor followed by the view
    commands],
)

Rotating keeps the point you grabbed where it is, so you can look at a small detail at the end
of a long structure from all sides without it leaving the screen.

  the view rotates about])

Keyboard shortcuts of the main window: #key("Ctrl+N") new, #key("Ctrl+O") open,
#key("Ctrl+S") save, #key("Ctrl+Shift+S") save as, #key("F5") run analysis, #key("Del")
delete the selected tree item, #key("Space") activate or deactivate it. In dialogs
#key("Enter") means OK and #key("Esc") Cancel.

=== Views

The projection is orthographic. Y points up in the front view.

- #ui("Front"), #ui("Back"), #ui("Left"), #ui("Right"), #ui("Top"), #ui("Bottom") and
  #ui("Isometric") are on the toolbar and in the #ui("View") menu.
- #ui("Vertical View") rolls the view about the viewing direction so that the global axis
  closest to screen-up points exactly up.
- #menu("View", "View Normal to Axis", "X/Y/Z") looks along an axis onto the plane normal to it.
- #menu("View", "Isometric, Axis Up", "X/Y/Z") shows the isometric view with the chosen axis
  pointing up, for models built with Z up.
- The *coordinate triad* in the lower right corner can be clicked: a click on an axis tip (or on
  its grey negative half) looks along that axis.

A 2D model always opens in the front view. Legend, info block, scale bar and min/max labels can
be dragged to another position in the view.

=== Showing and hiding parts

Each part in the tree has a visibility check box. #ui("Hide") and #ui("Show") in the context
menu of a part act on all selected parts. Hidden parts cannot be picked and are ignored by box
selection and by #ui("Zoom to Fit").

#ui("Hide All") and #ui("Show All") in the context menu of the #ui("Parts") node switch all parts
of the tree at once, in the geometry, FE model and results trees alike.

)

=== Screenshots <screenshot>

The #ui("Screenshot") button on the toolbar captures the 3D view including legend and labels:
#ui("Copy to Clipboard") or #ui("Save As ...") (PNG).

=== Section view <section-view>

#menu("View", "Section View ...") or the toolbar button cuts the model with a plane. Volume
elements show their cut faces with mesh edges and, on the #ui("Results") tab, with the result
colours.

#screenshot("section-view.png", [Section view of a result])

#fields(
  [Base plane], [XY, YZ or XZ at the coordinate given in #ui("Position").],
  [Plane feature], [A plane defined under #ui("Features") (@features), shifted by
    #ui("Distance") along its normal.],
  [Point and normal], [A point on the plane and its normal. #ui("From selection \"...\"") takes
    the centre of the clicked nodes, edge or face (for example the centre of a hole).
    #ui("From two points") takes the normal from two clicked points, the #ui("X")/#ui("Y")/#ui("Z")
    buttons set it to an axis.],
  [Position slider], [Moves the plane through the model.],
  [Flip], [Shows the other half.],
  [Lighten cut surfaces], [Draws the cut faces lighter (default on).],
)

In the 3D view the plane has a manipulator: drag the arrow to move the plane, drag the arcs to
tilt it. Changes are shown at once. #ui("OK") keeps the section, #ui("Deactivate") removes it,
#ui("Cancel") restores the previous state. #menu("View", "Section View Off") removes the section
as well.

=== Exploded view <exploded-view>

#menu("View", "Exploded View ...") pulls the parts of an assembly apart for display. The mesh
itself is not changed; parts that share nodes move together. A left click on the toolbar button
switches the exploded view on and off, a right click opens the settings.

#screenshot("exploded-view.png", [Exploded view dialog])

#fields(
  [Explosion method], [#ui("Disassembly"): each part moves the way it would be taken off, along
    the normal of its mating face or the axis of its bore. #ui("Assembly center"): the parts move
    away from the centre of the assembly. #ui("Center point"): the parts move away from the
    given point (#ui("Model Center") fills in the centre).],
  [Contact tolerance], [Disassembly only. Faces closer than this count as touching. 0 means
    1/1000 of the assembly diagonal.],
  [Sequential], [Disassembly only. Takes the assembly apart level by level.],
  [Direction], [XYZ, X, Y, Z, XY, XZ or YZ. Movements along the other axes are suppressed.],
  [Magnification], [How far the parts move at scale factor 1 (default 2).],
  [Scale factor], [0 = assembled, 1 = fully exploded (default 0.5). Also set with the
    #ui("Assembled - Exploded") slider.],
)
