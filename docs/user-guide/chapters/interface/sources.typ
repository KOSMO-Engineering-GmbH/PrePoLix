== Source blocks <source-blocks>

Besides analyses, the project schematic holds *source blocks*: blocks that only give data to
analyses through links. They have no steps and are not solved, and #ui("Update Project")
passes them by; the mesh export block at the end of this section takes data instead of giving
it. Add one from #menu("Project") or by double-clicking or right-clicking the background of the schematic;
its header has its own tint, so that it stands apart from the analyses. Its context menu has
#ui("Edit ..."), #ui("Rename ..."), #ui("Duplicate") and #ui("Delete ..."); a double-click
opens its editor in the project window. Deleting a source block removes its links; the
analyses keep copies of what they took.

=== Materials <materials-block>

A materials block holds materials in the project file, so that several analyses use the same
definition: change it once in the block and every analysis that links it follows. Unlike the
material library (@materials), which belongs to you and every project you open, the block
belongs to the project and travels with it.

#screenshot("materials-block.png", [A materials block: Static takes S235, Modal takes all of
  them])

Its rows are #ui("Materials"), which gives all of its materials, and below it one row per
material; the arrow in front of #ui("Materials") hides and shows them. Drag a row to the
#ui("Setup") row of an analysis, or to its #ui("Materials") row or a material once
#ui("Setup") is open, as with links between analyses (@data-links). A link of all materials
also passes on materials added to the block later; while the block shows its materials, it is
drawn as a wire per material. In the analysis window the linked
materials carry the link sign and are read-only; #ui("Open Materials") in their dialog opens
the block's editor.

#screenshot("materials-block-editor.png", [The editor of a materials block])

#fields(
  [Shown in], [The unit system the values are shown and typed in. Like the values of an
    analysis they are stored in SI units, so each analysis shows them in its own.],
  [New ...], [Defines a new material in the dialog of the FE Model tree (@materials).],
  [Edit ...], [Edits the selected material; a double-click on it does the same.],
  [Delete], [Removes the selected material.],
  [Add from Library ...], [Opens the material library (@material-library) with the block's
    materials in place of the model's: copy materials from the library into the block, or from
    the block into the library.],
  [Import from Analysis], [Copies the materials of an analysis into the block, so that a
    project can gather them in one place afterwards. A material of the same name is replaced.],
)

#ui("OK") keeps the changes, and the analyses that link the block take them at once;
#ui("Cancel") drops them.

=== Box and Rectangle meshes <mesh-block>

A mesh block makes a structured mesh from a few numbers, without geometry and without Gmsh:
#menu("Project", "Add Mesh", "Box") meshes a box with hexahedra for 3D analyses,
#menu("Project", "Add Mesh", "Rectangle") a rectangle in the X-Y plane with quadrilaterals for
2D analyses. Link its #ui("Mesh") row to the #ui("Mesh") row of analyses of the same model
space; several analyses can share one mesh block.

#screenshot("mesh-block.png", [A box linked to an analysis, its parameters in the block])

Its parameters are rows of the block under #ui("Mesh"), like the inputs of a Blender node:
#ui("X"), #ui("Y"), #ui("Z") of the corner it starts at and the edge lengths #ui("Lx"),
#ui("Ly"), #ui("Lz") in the block's units, the numbers of elements #ui("nx"), #ui("ny"),
#ui("nz") as whole numbers and the #ui("Element") type. Click a field to type a value, or drag
it; a rectangle has no Z rows. Once a parameter changes, the #ui("Mesh") row shows the mesh out
of date. The violet pins on the left of the numbers take a value from a Parameters block
(@parameters-block). To make the mesh finer or coarser as a whole, put a Refine Mesh block
after it (@refine-mesh).

Its sides are node sets and surfaces at once, named after the axis and the side they lie on:
#ui("X-") at the smallest X, #ui("X+") at the largest, then #ui("Y-"), #ui("Y+") and, for a
box, #ui("Z-") and #ui("Z+"). Boundary conditions and loads pick them under #ui("Node set") or
#ui("Surface") without selecting anything. The elements form the part #ui("BOX") or
#ui("RECTANGLE"), which a section takes.

The sides, edges and corners are also faces, edges and points of geometry. A selection in
the 3D view with #ui("Faces, edges and points") picks a whole side of the box, and it stays on
that side when the mesh is made anew with other divisions, other lengths or another
refinement, as on imported geometry. A selection of single nodes or element faces holds only
for the mesh it was made on.

#screenshot("box-face-remeshed.png", [A boundary condition picked on the end face of a box with
  12 x 2 x 2 elements, after the box was made anew with 24 x 4 x 2 elements])

A double-click on the block's name opens all its parameters in a dialog, with what the rows
leave out: the model space of a rectangle and the units the lengths are shown in.

#screenshot("mesh-block-editor.png", [The parameters of a box])

#fields(
  [Model space], [Rectangle only: plane stress, plane strain or axisymmetric. It is fixed while
    analyses link the mesh, which have the same model space. An axisymmetric rectangle lies at
    X >= 0, as X is the radius.],
  [Shown in], [The unit system the lengths are shown and typed in; they are stored in SI
    units.],
  [Origin], [The corner at the smallest coordinates.],
  [Edge lengths], [The size along each axis.],
  [Elements along], [The number of elements along each axis.],
  [Element type], [Box: C3D8, C3D8R, C3D8I, C3D20 or C3D20R. Rectangle: #ui("Quadratic")
    gives 8-node instead of 4-node elements, #ui("Reduced integration") the R types; the family
    (CPS, CPE or CAX) follows from the model space. The #ui("Element") row of a rectangle
    lists its four types.],
)

The line below the fields counts the elements and names the sides. #ui("OK") keeps the
parameters, and the #ui("Mesh") row of the block shows that its mesh is out of date.
#ui("Update Project") makes it anew before it solves (@update-project), and so does
#ui("Generate Mesh") in the block's context menu; the analyses that link it take the new mesh,
and their solutions are out of date.

#screenshot("mesh-block-result.png", [The box held at X- and pressed on Z+, solved])

=== Refine Mesh <refine-mesh>

A Refine Mesh block makes the mesh linked to it again, finer or coarser by a factor, and gives
the new mesh on. Add it with #menu("Project", "Add Mesh", "Refine Mesh"), drag the
#ui("Mesh") of a mesh block or of an analysis with imported geometry to the pin on the left of
its #ui("Mesh") row, and drag the pin on the right of that row to the #ui("Mesh") row of the
analyses that are to use the refined mesh. The mesh it refines stays as it is.

#screenshot("refine-mesh.png", [A box refined by 1.5 for the analysis Fine: the Factor takes the
  dashed wire of a parameter study, which varies it])

#fields(
  [Mesh], [Left pin: the mesh to refine. Right pin: the refined mesh, with its state.],
  [Factor], [How much finer the mesh is: 2 twice as fine, 0.5 half as fine, 1 as it is. Type
    or drag it in place, or drop the value of a Parameters block or an input of a parameter study on its pin
    (@parameter-study).],
)

What the factor does depends on where the mesh comes from:

- From a mesh block (Box, Rectangle): the numbers of elements along every edge are multiplied
  by the factor and rounded, so a box of 10 x 2 x 2 elements refined by 1.5 has 15 x 3 x 3. The
  block makes this mesh itself: once the factor or the mesh block changes, its #ui("Mesh") row
  is out of date and #ui("Update Project") or #ui("Generate Mesh") in its context menu makes it
  again.
- From an analysis with imported geometry: it gives the geometry with its mesh setup on, every
  element size divided by the factor (the max. and min. element size of the meshing
  parameters, those of Meshing Parameters items and the local mesh sizes). The analysis that
  takes it meshes the geometry with these sizes when it is solved; the sizes as set in the mesh
  setup stay. Its mesh can therefore not go to a Mesh Export block: export the mesh of the
  analysis that meshed it.

Refine Mesh blocks can follow each other; their factors multiply. A mesh read from an input
file has no parameters or geometry to mesh it again with, and the link is refused.

=== File <file-block>

A file block reads a file from outside the project and gives what it holds to analyses: the
results of a CalculiX run (`.frd`), the mesh of a CalculiX input file (`.inp`) or geometry
(STEP, IGES, BREP, STL). Add it with #menu("Project", "Add File ...") or from the picker; a
dialog asks for the file at once. Its rows depend on the file:

- results: #ui("Results") with a row per step of the file, whose pins link like the steps of
  an analysis, for example to the #ui("Global results") row of a submodel (@submodel);
- an input file: #ui("Mesh"), to link to the #ui("Mesh") row of analyses;
- geometry: #ui("Geometry"), to link to the #ui("Geometry") row of analyses.

#screenshot("file-block.png", [The results of a CalculiX run made elsewhere drive a submodel])

The #ui("File") row holds the path: type it, or double-click the block or use
#ui("Choose File ...") in its context menu. A relative path starts at the folder of the project
file. The block reads the file in the background and reads it again whenever it changes on
disk; #ui("Read Again") in the context menu reads it at once. The symbol of the first row shows
the state: a green tick once the file is read, a dash while no file is chosen or it is missing,
and an error when it could not be read, with the reason in the tooltip and the output pane.
A linked analysis is out of date when the file changes, and #ui("Update Project") solves it
again with the new data. The file is never written to; deleting the block leaves it as it is.

#limitation[Results of a file serve as global results of submodels only. Eigenmodes of a
frequency step cannot be linked, as the `.frd` file does not hold them.]

=== CAD Operation <cad-operation-block>

A CAD Operation block changes geometry before it is meshed: it rounds (#ui("Fillet")) or bevels
(#ui("Chamfer")) picked edges of solids or corners of flat faces, or moves picked planar faces (#ui("Push/Pull")), of the geometry
linked to it and gives the changed geometry on.
Add it with #menu("Project", "Add CAD Operation") or from the picker, drag the
#ui("Geometry") of a file block, of an analysis with imported geometry or of another CAD
Operation block to the pin on the left of its #ui("Geometry") row, and drag the pin on the
right of that row to the #ui("Geometry") row of the analyses that are to use the changed
geometry. Blocks in a row apply their operations one after the other.

Double-click the block to open its editor. It shows the geometry linked to it in its own 3D
view: click the edges or faces to act on, a click on a picked one removes it again. Picked
ones are drawn red, the one under the resting mouse orange. Choose the operation and type its
radius, distance or offset; #ui("Preview") applies it and shows the result, #ui("Input") goes back to picking.
#ui("OK") keeps the operation, and the result of the preview with it if nothing changed since.

#screenshot("cad-operation.png", [Two edges of a plate picked for a fillet of 1 mm])

#fields(
  [Geometry], [Left pin: the geometry to change. Right pin: the changed geometry, with its
    state.],
  [Fillet / Chamfer / Push/Pull], [What it does and to how many edges, corners or faces.],
  [Radius / Distance / Offset], [The radius of the fillet, the distance of the chamfer from
    the edge on both faces, or how far the faces move: outwards when positive, inwards when
    negative. Zero leaves the geometry as it is, so that a parameter study can
    switch the operation off in some design points. Type or drag it in place, or drop the value of a Parameters block or an
    input of a parameter study on its pin (@parameter-study): every design point then makes the
    geometry again, and the analyses after it mesh and solve it anew.],
)

Once the input geometry or the operation changes, the #ui("Geometry") row is out of date, and
#ui("Update Project") or #ui("Update Geometry") in the context menu makes it again; the
analyses linked to it mesh the new geometry. The picked edges are found again when the input
changes, for example when the file is edited in the CAD program, by where they lie, their kind
and their size; one that is no longer found has to be picked again. When OpenCASCADE cannot
make the operation, for example because the radius is larger than the faces next to an edge,
the row shows an error with the reason in its tooltip and the output pane, and the analyses
after the block are not solved; in a parameter study the design point fails.

==== Corners of 2D geometry <cad-corners-2d>

When the linked geometry has no solids, only faces, as for a plane stress, plane strain or
axisymmetric analysis, #ui("Fillet") and #ui("Chamfer") act on the corners of the faces: the
editor looks straight onto their plane and a click picks the corner nearest to it, drawn as a red
point. The fillet replaces the corner by an arc of the radius tangent to both edges; the chamfer
cuts it with a straight line at the distance from the corner on both edges. A corner where the
edges meet smoothly, such as the end of a fillet already in the sketch, has nothing to round and
the operation fails with that reason. A corner on an edge two faces share cannot be rounded either.
#ui("Push/Pull") is not offered for 2D geometry.

#screenshot("cad-corners-2d.png", [Two corners of a flat shoulder picked (left) and rounded with
  a radius of 4 mm (right)])

==== Push/Pull <push-pull>

#ui("Push/Pull") moves planar faces along their normal, for example to make a plate thicker,
a bracket longer or a shoulder higher. It adds a prism on the face to the solid, or cuts it
away for a negative offset, so neighbouring faces at right angles grow or shrink with it and
stay one face each. A sloped or rounded neighbour does not follow: it gets a step at the old
edge, which #ui("Preview") shows. Change the main sizes first and round the edges after, with
a second CAD Operation block behind the first. Curved faces cannot be picked. Several picked
faces move one after the other, so two faces that meet both move as a whole.

#screenshot("cad-push-pull.png", [The top face of a stepped bar picked to make it thicker])

==== Example: a fillet radius study <cad-fillet-study>

How much does a larger fillet at the shoulder of a stepped bar lower the stress? The project
for the answer has five blocks:

+ A file block reads the bar from a STEP file.
+ A CAD Operation block, #ui("Shoulder Fillet"), rounds the two edges in the inner corners of
  the shoulder.
+ The analysis #ui("Tension") takes its geometry from the fillet block, holds the wide end
  and pulls the narrow end by 0.04 mm.
+ A Measure block (@measure-block) reads the largest von Mises stress of its step.
+ A parameter study takes that value as its output and gives its input to the
  #ui("Radius") of the fillet block: drag the pin of the study's #ui("Inputs") row onto the pin
  of the #ui("Radius") row.

#screenshot("cad-fillet-study.png", [The study varies the fillet radius (dashed wire) and reads
  the largest stress of the analysis])

With five design points from 2 to 6 mm (#ui("Fill ...") in the study editor, @study-fill),
#ui("Run") makes the geometry again for each point, meshes it and solves it. The peak stress at
the shoulder falls from about 300 to 221 MPa, steeply up to 3 mm and less and less after
that:

#screenshot("cad-fillet-study-plot.png", [The plot of the study: the largest stress over the
  fillet radius])

=== Parameters <parameters-block>

A Parameters block holds named numbers that other blocks take through *value links*, so that
one number drives several places: the length of two meshes, or a size that is changed in one
spot. Add it with #menu("Project", "Add Parameters", "Parameters"); it starts with one length.

#screenshot("value-links.png", [The length of a Parameters block gives the edge length Lx of a
  box: the row of the box is read-only, in violet, and follows the parameter])

Each parameter is a row with its value, typed or dragged in place, and a violet pin on
either side. Drag the pin on the right to the pin on the left of a number of a mesh block
(#ui("X") to #ui("nz")), to the #ui("Factor") of a Refine Mesh block or to an exposed parameter
of an analysis or a Materials block (@exposed-parameters). The number then takes the value of
the parameter: it is shown in violet and read-only, and when the parameter changes the blocks
after it are out of date, so #ui("Update Project") meshes and solves again. The pin on the left
takes the value of another parameter. A value link joins like with like: a length goes to a
length, a force to a force, a count to a number of elements, a factor to #ui("Factor");
otherwise the output pane says why it was refused. Right-click the pin to remove the link; the
number keeps its last value.

A double-click on the block opens its editor:

#fields(
  [Shown in], [The unit system the values are shown and typed in; they are stored in SI
    units.],
  [Name], [The name of the parameter, unique in the block. Renaming it keeps its links.],
  [Kind], [#ui("Count") (a whole number of at least one), #ui("Factor") (a number without
    unit) or a physical quantity such as #ui("Length"), #ui("Force"), #ui("Pressure") or
    #ui("Temperature").],
  [Value], [The number.],
  [Remove], [Removes the parameter and its links.],
  [Add Parameter], [Adds a length.],
)

=== Math and Switch <math-switch>

A Math block computes a number from others, like the Math node of Blender: a height that is
twice a width, a thickness that never drops below a minimum. A Switch block picks one of
several numbers by an index, for variants such as three sheet thicknesses. Add them with
#menu("Project", "Add Parameters", "Math") and #menu("Project", "Add Parameters", "Switch"), or
search them with #key("Shift+A").

#screenshot("schematic-math-switch.png", [A parameter study varies the width and the variant:
  the Math block Height doubles the width, the Switch block Thickness picks the thickness of
  the variant, and both results are outputs of the study])

Their inputs are rows with a violet pin on the left: type a number, or drag a value pin to it,
from a Parameters block, from another Math or Switch block or from the #ui("Inputs") of a
parameter study (@parameter-study). The #ui("Result") row at the bottom shows the number the
block gives; drag its pin on the right to any number of the same kind, to another Math or
Switch block or to the #ui("Outputs") of a study. Blocks that take the result are out of date
when it changes, as with a parameter.

#fields(
  [Operation], [Math only: #ui("Add") (A + B), #ui("Subtract") (A - B), #ui("Multiply")
    (A × B), #ui("Divide") (A / B), #ui("Minimum"), #ui("Maximum") or #ui("Clamp"), which
    keeps #ui("Value") between #ui("Min") and #ui("Max"). A product or quotient gives no
    result when dividing by zero.],
  [Kind], [What the numbers are, as for a parameter: a length, a force, a count or a factor.
    #ui("Any") takes the kind of the first number linked to the block. The B of
    #ui("Multiply") and #ui("Divide") is always a factor, so a length times 2 stays a
    length.],
  [Index], [Switch only: which choice the block gives, counted from 1. Out of range, the block
    gives no result.],
  [Choice 1, 2, ...], [Switch only: the numbers to choose from. #ui("Add") adds one,
    #ui("Remove") removes the last one with its link; a switch holds up to 20.],
)

A value link joins like with like here too: once a block has a kind, it takes only numbers of
that kind, and the output pane says why a link was refused. Changing the operation removes
links to inputs the block no longer has.

=== Exposed parameters <exposed-parameters>

Any number of an analysis that a study or a Parameters block should set, such as a force, a
thickness or the Young's modulus of a material, is first *exposed*. In the dialog of the item,
a small #ui("P") button follows each number that can be exposed; click it and close the dialog
with #ui("OK"). The number then is a row of the analysis' block in the project window, under
#ui("Exposed Parameters"), with the value it has and a violet pin on the left. It also appears
in the FE Model tree under #ui("Exposed Parameters"), where a double-click opens the item.

#screenshot("expose-button.png", [The #ui("P") button next to the components of a force: the Y
  component is exposed])

#screenshot("exposed-parameters.png", [The force of the analysis is exposed and given by the
  Parameters block: its row under Exposed Parameters is read-only and follows the parameter])

The row is named after the item and the number, such as #ui("Force-1 Y"); right-click it to
rename it or to remove the parameter, which leaves the number as it is. Type a value in the row,
or drag a value pin of a Parameters block to its pin: the number then follows the parameter,
and the field in the dialog is read-only while the link is there. Renaming the item keeps the
parameter. The numbers that can be exposed are those of loads, boundary conditions, defined
fields and initial conditions, of materials and sections, the time period and first increment
of steps and the number of modes of a frequency step. A Materials block (@materials-block)
exposes the numbers of its own materials in the same way.

Exposing a number does not change the analysis: only a new value makes it out of date.

=== Measure <measure-block>

A Measure block computes one key figure from the results of a step: the largest von Mises
stress, the displacement of a node, a total force or an eigenfrequency. It is the number a
parameter study reads, and a quick way to see the figure that matters without opening the results.
Add it with #menu("Project", "Add Measure"); it starts with the largest von Mises stress.

#screenshot("measure-blocks.png", [Two Measure blocks: the lowest temperature of the thermal
  step Heat and the largest von Mises stress of the step Load that uses those temperatures])

Drag the pin of a step under #ui("Results") of an analysis to the #ui("Results") row of the
block, with an orange wire like every link of results. A Measure block measures one step;
another wire to it takes the place of the first. The block shows what it measures and, in its
last row, the value in its units with the state of the value:

- a green tick when it was computed from the results as they are and those are up to date;
- the orange arrows when the results are out of date, after a change of the analysis or of a
  block it links to; #ui("Update Project") solves the analysis again and the value follows;
- a dash while there are no results, or when the results lack what it measures. The output
  pane then says why, for example "step 1 has no field STRESS in the results".

The value is computed anew in the background whenever the results or its definition change,
and the output pane prints it ("Max stress: Maximum of STRESS MISES = 8.6 MPa"). The project
file keeps the value, so a reopened project shows it at once. The pin on the right of the
value row gives it to a parameter study (@parameter-study).

#screenshot("measure-editor.png", [The editor of a Measure block])

A double-click on the block opens its editor:

#fields(
  [Measure], [What it computes: #ui("Field extreme"), #ui("Value at a node"),
    #ui("History output") or #ui("Eigenfrequency").],
  [Shown in], [The unit system of the value; it is stored in SI units.],
  [Field, Component], [The field and its component as the Results workspace names them:
    STRESS MISES, DISP ALL, NDTEMP T, TOTAL_FORCE RF3 for a history output. With results
    linked, both are lists of what those results have (a name they lack is shown in the
    warning color); without, they are typed. The value is that of the last increment of the
    step.],
  [Take], [For a field extreme: #ui("Maximum"), #ui("Minimum") or #ui("Largest magnitude"),
    which keeps the sign.],
  [Region], [For a field extreme: all nodes, or a region of the analysis whose results are
    linked: a node set of its mesh or model, or the region of a boundary condition or load,
    such as #ui("Displacement_Rotation-1 (boundary condition)"). The region is found on the mesh the results
    were solved on, so a region picked on geometry or on the sides of a mesh block follows
    every new mesh of a parameter study.],
  [Node], [For a value at a node: its number.],
  [Set], [For a history output: the set of the history output, as written to the `.dat` file;
    a list of the sets of the linked results.],
  [Mode], [For an eigenfrequency: the mode, counted from 1, of a frequency step.],
)

=== Mesh Export <mesh-export>

A mesh export block is the opposite of a source: it takes a mesh and writes it to a file, as
a CalculiX input file (`.inp`) with the nodes, the elements, and the node sets and surfaces
of the mesh. Add it with #menu("Project", "Add Mesh Export") or from the picker under
#ui("Export"), and drag the #ui("Mesh") row of a mesh block or an analysis to its #ui("Mesh")
row. Several export blocks may take the same mesh.

#screenshot("mesh-export.png", [A box whose mesh is written to box.inp])

The block has two rows. #ui("Mesh") is the input; its symbol shows whether the file is up to
date. #ui("File") is the file to write: type its path, or double-click the block's name to
pick it in a dialog. A relative path starts at the folder of the project file, so a project
moved together with its export folder keeps working; while the project is unsaved it starts
at the folder the program was started in.

#ui("Update Project") writes the file once everything before the block is done: the mesh of
a mesh block is made first, an analysis is solved first, and the file is written from the mesh
as it is then. It writes only when something changed, that is when the mesh or the path is
new or the file is gone, so an update of a project that did not change leaves the file alone.
If an analysis before the block fails, the block does not write. #ui("Export Now") in the
block's context menu writes the file at once, whatever the state.

The file holds the mesh only, not the loads or steps of an analysis that takes the same mesh,
so it reads back as a mesh when an analysis imports it. A path the program cannot write
shows as an error in the #ui("Mesh") row's tooltip and in the output window.
