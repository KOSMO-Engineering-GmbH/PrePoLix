== Sections <sections>

A section assigns a material to elements. Every element needs a section, otherwise the model check
reports "Elements without material". Create sections with #menu("Model", "Create Section ...").

#screenshot("section.png", [Section dialog])

#fields(
  [Type], [#ui("Solid"), #ui("Truss") or #ui("Beam").],
  [Material], [One of the model's materials.],
  [Region], [#ui("Parts") (picked in the 3D view) or an #ui("Element Set") (@mesh-sets).],
)

=== Solid section

For solid elements and the plane and axisymmetric elements of 2D models. In plane stress and plane
strain models the section has a #ui("Thickness") (default 1). Written as `*SOLID SECTION`.

=== Truss section

For line parts that carry only axial force. #ui("Cross-section area") must be positive. The lines
are written as `T3D2` truss elements.

#note[Trusses must form a stable truss structure. If they can move without resistance, the model
check reports "Truss structure is a mechanism".]

=== Cross-sections <cross-sections>

The profile of a beam is a cross-section of its own, kept under #ui("Sections") >
#ui("Cross-Sections") in the FE Model tree, so that several beam sections share one definition.
Double-click #ui("Cross-Sections"), right-click it and choose #ui("Create ..."), or use
#menu("Model", "Create Cross-Section ...").

#fields(
  [Profile], [#ui("Rectangular") (thicknesses a and b in the 1- and 2-direction),
    #ui("Circular") (radius), #ui("Pipe") (outer radius and wall thickness) or #ui("Box") (widths a
    and b and the wall thicknesses t1 to t4 at +1, +2, -1 and -2).],
)

The sketch below the fields shows the profile with the 1-direction to the right and the
2-direction up, starting at the beam's nodes. The red dashed lines are the principal axes through
the centroid (circle): #ui("I") has the largest second moment of area, #ui("II") the smallest.
Below the sketch are the area A, the position of the centroid, the second moments of area I11
(about the 1-axis) and I22 (about the 2-axis) and the principal moments with the angle of axis I
from the 1-direction, in the units of the model.

#screenshot("cross-section-dialog.png", [The cross-sections under Sections and the dialog of a box
profile whose thicker wall at +1 moves the centroid in the 1-direction])

Every dimension can be exposed as a parameter with the #ui("P") button next to it, so that a
parameter study can vary the profile. Renaming a cross-section renames it in the beam sections
that use it. In the project schematic the cross-sections are a category of the setup that other
analyses can link to, like the materials.

=== Beam section

#fields(
  [Cross-section], [One of the model's cross-sections (@cross-sections); the dialog shows its
    sketch. A new beam section takes the first one.],
  [Normal (1-direction)], [#ui("Automatic") uses the global z axis, or x for beams parallel to z.
    #ui("Vector") takes the direction from x, y and z; it must not be parallel to a beam.],
  [Offset in 1-/2-direction], [Shifts the beam axis by a multiple of the section dimension.],
)

Beams are written as `*BEAM SECTION` with `B31` or `B32` elements. Pipe and box sections need
quadratic lines and are written as `B32R`, as CalculiX requires.

==== Beam profiles in the FE model and the results <beam-profiles>

The FE model draws beams as their profile swept along the line, as CalculiX expands them: the
1-direction is the #ui("Normal") turned perpendicular to the beam, the 2-direction the beam axis
crossed with it, and the offsets move the profile off the nodes (0.5 puts the nodes on the
positive face). Pipes and boxes show their hollow walls. Where two elements of a line meet
the profile runs on and its outline marks the element border; at the ends of a line, at kinks
of more than 45 degrees and at branches each element ends with a face. Trusses are drawn as round
bars of their cross-section area.

#screenshot("beam-profiles.png", [A frame with a rectangular beam (left), a pipe frame (right),
truss bracing and a roof of shells, drawn with their sections.])

In the Results workspace CalculiX hands the beams back as the solids it expanded them to
(pipes and boxes without their hollow). Trusses stay lines, and so do beams in results written with
`OUTPUT=2D`; PrePoLix then sweeps the profiles of the input file CalculiX ran along the deformed
lines, coloured by the shown result. Such a profile is moved with its nodes, not turned by
their rotations.

Turn the profiles off with #menu("View", "Beam Profiles") or in the #link(<settings>)[settings]
under #ui("Graphics") to see the lines only. Picking still selects the lines.

#limitation[Line elements can only be used in 3D models.]
