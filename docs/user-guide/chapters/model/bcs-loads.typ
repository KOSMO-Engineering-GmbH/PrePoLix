== Boundary conditions <boundary-conditions>

Boundary conditions belong to a step. Create them with #ui("Create ...") on #ui("BCs") of a step,
or with #menu("Model", "Create Boundary Condition ...") for the last step. The dialog lists only
the types the step accepts. In the 3D view, supports are drawn as cones (translations) and
plates (rotations).

#fields(
  [Displacement/Rotation], [Prescribed values for the ticked components `U1`, `U2`, `U3`
    (length) and `UR1`, `UR2`, `UR3` (angle in radians). Unticked components are free. A new
    one holds all components at zero, a fixed support; in 2D only `U1` and `U2` are shown.
    Rotations act on nodes of beams and shells only; solid nodes have none, so zero rotations
    there change nothing. On a reference point of a rigid body (@rigid-body) in a 2D plane
    stress or plane strain model, `UR3` is shown too: it prescribes the rotation about z of the
    point and so of the rigid body (axisymmetric models have no rotation).],
  [Remote Displacement], [Moves the selection with a point at its centre or elsewhere, rigidly or
    as a mean (@remote-displacement).],
  [Temperature], [Prescribed temperature (heat transfer, coupled and uncoupled steps).],
  [Submodel], [Displacements taken from the global model (static steps of a submodel,
    @submodel). The check boxes select the displacements U1 to U3; the step of the global
    results is the one linked to the #ui("Global results") row. The global results hold no
    rotations.],
  [Symmetry], [Holds the selected faces in their plane like a mirror image (@symmetry).],
)

The region is a selection of faces, edges or nodes, a node set or a surface. Displacement and
temperature boundary conditions can follow an #ui("Amplitude") (@amplitudes).

=== Remote displacement <remote-displacement>

A #ui("Remote Displacement") prescribes the displacements `U1` to `U3` and rotations `UR1` to
`UR3` of a point, and the selection follows the point: a shaft end turned by an angle, or a bolt
hole held in place while the part turns about it. Unticked components of the point are free. A
new one holds all components at zero, which clamps the selection rigidly in place.

#screenshot("remote-displacement.png", [Deformable remote displacement on the bore of a plate,
  held in place but free to turn about z like on a pin])

#fields(
  [Behavior], [How the selection follows the point, see below. #ui("Rigid") by default.],
  [Coordinate system], [The directions of the components and of the coordinates below:
    #ui("Global") or a coordinate system under #ui("Features") (@features). In a cylindrical
    system `U1` is radial, `U2` tangential and `U3` axial, taken at the point, and the
    coordinates are R, Theta in degrees and Z.],
  [Location], [#ui("Centroid") puts the point at the area-weighted centre of the selected faces
    (of the edges in 2D, the mean of the nodes when no faces are selected).
    #ui("Coordinates") puts it anywhere, given in the coordinate system; switching starts from
    the centroid. #ui("Point") shows where the point is, in global coordinates.],
  [Pinball region], [When ticked, only the selected nodes within this distance of the point
    follow it. Ticking it starts with the distance of the farthest node.],
)

The ticked components, the coordinates of the location and the pinball radius have a #ui("P")
button, so a parameter study can vary them (@exposed-parameters). Only numbers that are set can
be exposed: tick the component, choose #ui("Coordinates") or tick the pinball region first. The
angle Theta of a cylindrical system is the one number that cannot be exposed.

#screenshot("remote-displacement-expose.png", [The #ui("P") buttons of a remote displacement:
  the location, the pinball radius and the prescribed components can be exposed])

The three behaviors match those of Ansys:

- #ui("Rigid"): the selection keeps its shape and moves with the point as a rigid body. This
  stiffens the selection, like a pin glued into the bore.
- #ui("Deformable"): the point moves with the area-weighted mean of the selection, and the
  selection may deform. Its mean displacement equals that of the point and its mean rotation
  about the point that of the point, so a bore can ovalize while it is held. This is the
  distributing coupling (RBE3) of other programs.
- #ui("Coupled"): every node of the selection shifts like the point in the ticked directions
  and is free in the others. The point has no rotations here, so `UR1` to `UR3` are not shown.

You define no reference point, rigid body or equation for it. When the input file is written,
PrePoLix adds a reference node and a rotation node at the point. #ui("Rigid") writes a
`*RIGID BODY` on the selection; #ui("Deformable") and #ui("Coupled") write `*EQUATION`s
between the nodes and the point. The values go on these two nodes, with a `*TRANSFORM` when a
coordinate system is chosen. The point is computed on the current mesh, so a selection of
geometry faces keeps working after remeshing. In the 3D view the supports are drawn at the point
with lines to the selection.

- In plane stress and plane strain models the point has `U1`, `U2` and `UR3` (rotation about
  z); in axisymmetric models `U1` and `U2`.
- Remote displacements of several steps on the same selection with the same behavior,
  coordinate system, location and pinball region share one point. A study that varies the
  location or the pinball radius in one step only gives that step a point of its own on the
  same nodes, which the model check reports; expose the number in every step and link all of
  them to the same value to keep one point. The rigid body or the
  equations belong to the whole model, so they still act in steps without the boundary
  condition.
- A node can belong to only one rigid body or remote point: do not let the selection overlap
  that of another remote displacement or a rigid body constraint (@rigid-body). The model check
  (@model-check) reports "Nodes in several rigid bodies or remote points" otherwise.
- Ansys features that CalculiX cannot carry over are left out: the #ui("Beam") behavior, the
  augmented Lagrange formulation (PrePoLix always writes exact constraints) and tabular values
  per component (one amplitude acts on all components).

=== Motion preview <motion-preview>

When a displacement boundary condition follows an amplitude, a play button appears right of the
#ui("Amplitude") field. It previews the prescribed motion in the 3D view: the nodes of the region
move by the prescribed displacements times the amplitude, passing through the amplitude's time
range in three seconds and starting again after a short rest. The button turns into a stop
button; the preview also ends when the dialog closes or the amplitude is removed. Changes to the
values, the amplitude or the region show while it plays.

#screenshot("motion-preview.png", [Tip of a cantilever moved up and down by an amplitude])

Only the nodes of the region move; the rest of the mesh stays in place, so the elements next to
the region stretch. The motion is exaggerated so that the largest displacement is a quarter of
the model size; the dialog shows the current time of the amplitude and this scale. Rotations
(`UR1` to `UR3`) are not shown.

== Loads <loads>

Loads are created like boundary conditions, with #ui("Create ...") on #ui("Loads") of a step or
#menu("Model", "Create Load ..."). A frequency step takes no loads.

#screenshot("selection.png", [Force on the end face of a plate])

#fields(
  [Force], [The default load: a *total* force `F1`, `F2`, `F3` on whatever the region holds,
    faces, edges or points (@force-region). When the input file is written it is distributed
    to the nodes (`*CLOAD`). With #ui("Apply to all nodes") the whole force acts at every node
    of the region instead, as a concentrated force in CalculiX; it is off by default.],
  [Moment], [`M1`, `M2`, `M3` at the reference point of a rigid body (@rigid-body) or at every
    node of beams and shells, which have rotations. 3D models only.],
  [Pressure], [Pressure on faces; positive values push into the material (`*DLOAD`).],
  [Moving Load], [Wheel forces that travel over faces, one static step per position
    (@moving-load).],
  [Concentrated Flux], [Heat flow into every node of the region (`*CFLUX`).],
  [Surface Flux], [Heat flux density into faces (`*DFLUX`).],
  [Body Flux], [Heat generated per volume in parts or elements (`*DFLUX`, `BF`).],
  [Film (Convection)], [Convection to the surroundings with #ui("Sink temperature") and
    #ui("Film coefficient") (`*FILM`).],
  [Radiation], [Radiation to the surroundings with #ui("Sink temperature") and
    #ui("Emissivity") (`*RADIATE`). Needs the physical constants of the model
    (@model-properties).],
)

Every load can follow an #ui("Amplitude"). Film and radiation have a second amplitude for the film
coefficient or the emissivity.

In 2D models face loads act on element edges. In axisymmetric models forces act on the full
circumference.

#limitation[Line loads (force per length) are not available in the dialogs; a
#ui("Force") along edges takes the total force (@force-region). Bolt pre-tension:
@pre-tension. Defined temperature fields: @defined-fields.]

=== What a force acts on <force-region>

A #ui("Force") picks its region like a boundary condition: in the #ui("Selection") window
#ui("Faces, edges and points") takes the face, edge or corner point under the click, and
#ui("Region") can also be a node set, a surface or the #ui("Reference Point") of a rigid body
(@rigid-body). The force is always the total and is distributed to the nodes when the input file
is written:

#fields(
  [Faces], [By the face areas and the element shape functions. In 2D models the faces are the
    edges of the outline.],
  [Edges], [By the edge lengths, as the consistent nodal forces of a constant line load: on
    quadratic elements an edge's end nodes take 1/6 and its midside node 4/6 of the edge's
    share. Useful on the free edge of a shell or a membrane.],
  [Points, nodes, node sets], [In equal shares, so a single node, such as the tip of a beam,
    takes all of it. Nodes picked with the mesh based modes count as points.],
  [Reference point], [The whole force acts on the rigid body.],
)

When a selection mixes them, faces come before edges and edges before points: only the faces of a
selection of faces and edges carry the force.

#screenshot("force-dialog.png", [Force dialog with the Selection window])

== Hiding symbols <hide-symbols>

#ui("Hide") in the context menu of a boundary condition or load removes its symbol from the 3D
view, #ui("Show") brings it back; the tree marks a hidden item with an eye. #ui("Hide All") and
#ui("Show All") in the context menu of #ui("BCs") or #ui("Loads") of a step do this for all of
them. Constraints are hidden the same way (@constraints). A hidden item is still
drawn while it is selected, and the setting is saved with the project. Hiding changes only the
view; #ui("Deactivate") leaves an item out of the input file.
