== Symmetry boundary condition <symmetry>

A #ui("Symmetry") boundary condition cuts a symmetric model in half: select the faces that lie in
the cut plane and PrePoLix holds them as the mirror image would. You do not have to work out
which components of a #ui("Displacement/Rotation") boundary condition to fix. Create it with
#ui("Create ...") on #ui("BCs") of a step or #menu("Model", "Create Boundary Condition ...") and
choose the type #ui("Symmetry").

#fields(
  [Plane normal], [#ui("From selection") (default) fits the plane to the selected nodes;
    #ui("Normal") shows the normal found. #ui("Entered") takes the components #ui("N1"),
    #ui("N2"), #ui("N3") instead, e.g. for a single node of a beam.],
  [Region], [The faces, edges or nodes in the cut plane, a node set or a surface. On shells,
    select the edge in the cut: the plane goes through the edge, perpendicular to the shells. In
    2D models select the edges on the symmetry line.],
)

The boundary condition holds the displacement normal to the plane and, at nodes of beams and
shells, the rotations about the two axes in the plane. Solids have no rotations, so for them
only the normal displacement counts. The plane is stored as your selection, not as numbers, so it
follows the mesh after remeshing.

plates for the held rotations])

In the input file, a plane normal to a coordinate axis becomes a plain `*BOUNDARY`, e.g. for the
plane $z = "const"$ the components 3, 4 and 5. Any other plane gets a local coordinate system for
its nodes (`*TRANSFORM, TYPE=R`) with the local x axis along the normal, and `*BOUNDARY` holds
the local components 1, 5 and 6.

=== Warnings <symmetry-warnings>

If the selection makes no sense as a symmetry plane, the dialog says so in red, and the model
check marks the boundary condition with a warning sign (@model-check):

- *Not planar*: the nodes are not all on one plane, e.g. a curved face or faces of two
  different planes. The message gives the largest distance from the best-fitting plane. The
  input file is still written, with that plane.
- *No plane*: a single node, or nodes on a line that is not a shell edge, do not fix a plane.
  Enter the normal, or the input file cannot be written.
- *Axisymmetric*: in an axisymmetric model only a line of constant y (perpendicular to the axis)
  is a symmetry plane.
- *Shared nodes*: CalculiX reads every boundary condition and point load at the nodes of a
  skewed plane in its local system. Zero displacements in all directions, such as a #ui("Fixed")
  support at an edge of the plane, are the same in any system and give no warning.

#limitation[A node can only have one local system. Where two skewed symmetry planes meet, keep
the line between them out of one of the selections and support it with a #ui("Fixed") or a
#ui("Displacement/Rotation") boundary condition. Shells with a skewed plane are a little softer
next to the plane than with a plane normal to an axis, because CalculiX couples the expanded
shell nodes there (about 0.5 % in a plate one element wide).]
