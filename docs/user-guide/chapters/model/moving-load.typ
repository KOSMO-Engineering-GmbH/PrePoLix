== Moving load <moving-load>

A #ui("Moving Load") drives a group of wheels over a structure: a crane over its runway beam, a
trolley over a crane bridge, a vehicle over a bridge deck. CalculiX has no such load, so PrePoLix
writes one static step per position, each with the wheel forces at that position. No script is
needed. Create it with #ui("Create ...") on #ui("Loads") of a static step or
#menu("Model", "Create Load ...") and pick the type #ui("Moving Load").

    turns one wheel at +2100 into a symmetric pair at ±2100.],
)

Below the table the dialog shows the total force of all wheels. In the 3D view the wheels are
drawn at the first and at the last position; here one wheel is off the girder at the start and at
the end.

#heading(level: 3, outlined: false)[Wheels at the ends of the structure]

A wheel whose contact patch is off the selected faces carries no force; one that is partly off
carries the part of its force that falls on the faces. So a crane can drive over the runway beam
from one end to the other and off it: put #ui("Start") and #ui("End") before and behind the
beam. For a trolley that stays on its bridge choose them so that every wheel stays on the faces.
The model check warns with "Wheel off the surface" when a wheel leaves the faces at some
positions; this is a reminder, not an error.

#heading(level: 3, outlined: false)[Input file and results]

The step is written once per position (`** Moving load position 3 of 31, Crane at -500`),
everything else in the step stays the same in all of them. The wheel forces become `*CLOAD` on
the nodes of the faces under each patch, with the shares of a uniform pressure on the covered
part of each face (as for a #ui("Force"), @loads). The results have one step per
position: step through them, or animate them with the animation type #ui("Steps")
(@animation) to see the load travel. The animation keeps one deformation scale for all
positions.

#note[Each position is a separate linear static analysis, as in the usual script of load steps.
Dynamic effects of the moving mass are not included.]
