= The FE Model

The #ui("FE Model") tab holds everything CalculiX needs besides the mesh: materials, sections,
constraints, contacts, amplitudes, initial conditions and steps with their boundary conditions,
loads and outputs. Most items are created from the #ui("Model") and #ui("Interaction") menus or
with #ui("Create ...") in the context menu of their container in the tree.

== Model properties <model-properties>

#menu("Model", "Model Properties ...") (or a double-click on #ui("Model") in the tree) shows
the basic properties of the model. The same dialog opens when an analysis is created
(@new-analysis); the model space and the unit system are chosen there and fixed from then on.
The dialog of an existing analysis shows them, but only the model type and the physical
constants can still be changed. For another model space or unit system, create a new analysis.

=== Model space

/ 3D: solids, shells and lines.
/ 2D plane stress: plane elements (`CPS`), the section has a thickness.
/ 2D plane strain: plane elements (`CPE`), the section has a thickness.
/ 2D axisymmetric: axisymmetric elements (`CAX`). The y axis is the axis of rotation, the model
  must lie at x ≥ 0.

All 2D models must lie in the global X-Y plane. Hovering over a model space shows a short hint
on when to use it: plane stress for thin parts loaded in their plane, plane strain for long
prismatic parts without strain out of the plane, axisymmetric for bodies of revolution.

Geometry and meshes must fit the model space of their analysis: a 2D mesh from an input file
cannot be imported into a 3D analysis, nor solids into a 2D one.

#note(title: "Axisymmetric models")[As in CalculiX, forces in an axisymmetric model act on the
full 360° circumference. Forces are distributed according to the radius.]

=== Model type

#ui("General model") or #ui("Submodel"). A submodel takes the displacements at its cut
boundaries from a global model. With #ui("Submodel"), the block of the analysis in the project
schematic gets a #ui("Global results") row: the results of a step of the global analysis are
dragged there (@submodel). No result file is picked in the dialog.

=== Unit system <unit-systems>

#fields(
  [Unitless], [No units. Numbers are taken as they are.],
  [m, kg, s, °C], [SI units.],
  [mm, ton, s, °C], [The default. Force in N, stress in MPa, density in t/mm³.],
  [m, ton, s, °C], [Force in kN, stress in kPa.],
  [in, lbf·s²/in, s, °F], [US units. Force in lbf, stress in psi.],
)

The dialog lists the base and derived units of the chosen system.

*How values are stored.* PrePoLix stores every value of the mesh, the geometry and the model in
SI units (m, kg, s, N, Pa; temperatures in °C), whatever the unit system of the analysis. The
unit system only decides how values are *shown and typed*: a dialog of an analysis in mm, ton,
s shows lengths in mm and stresses in MPa, and converts what you type. A value typed with
another unit is converted too, for example `3 cm` in a length field becomes 30 mm. The input
file CalculiX gets is therefore always in SI units, which the keyword editor says above its
text (@keyword-editor); results are shown in the unit system of the analysis (legend, scale bar,
queries, tables). Because of this, analyses of one project may use different unit systems and
still share meshes, materials and results through links (@links).

=== Physical constants

#ui("Absolute zero") and #ui("Stefan-Boltzmann") are only needed for thermal radiation.
#ui("Defaults") fills them in for the selected unit system. They are written as
`*PHYSICAL CONSTANTS`.
