== Campbell diagram <campbell>

A Campbell diagram shows the eigenfrequencies of a rotor over its speed of rotation. CalculiX
computes the whirling modes for one speed per run, so PrePoLix runs the analysis once per speed
and collects the results.

The sweep lives in a #ui("Campbell") block of the project schematic (@project-window), which
takes the analysis to sweep and keeps the diagram. The analysis needs an active
#ui("Centrifugal") load, whose axis and point tell how the rotor turns, and a
#ui("Complex Frequency") step (@complex-frequency); the speed of the load does not matter, 0
included, as the sweep sets it. #menu("Analysis", "Campbell diagram ...") in the window of such
an analysis opens its Campbell block, and makes one next to the analysis and links it first if
there is none. A block can also be added from the block picker or the context menu of the
schematic (category #ui("Campbell")); then drag the #ui("Setup") pin of the analysis to the
#ui("Analysis") row of the block.

speeds of its sweep and the critical speeds of its diagram])

The block shows the state of its diagram in its #ui("Analysis") row, how many speeds it has and
up to five critical speeds. The speeds and the settings of the sweep are saved in the project
file, so the diagram is there again when the project is opened. The diagram stays up to date
while the analysis is unchanged, apart from the speed of its centrifugal loads; once the mesh or
the model of the analysis changes, the block turns out of date. #ui("Update Project") starts the
sweep of every Campbell block that is out of date or has not swept yet, beside the solves of the
analyses; the sweep runs the model of its analysis by itself and needs no results of it.

Double-clicking the block, or #ui("Open Diagram ...") in its context menu, opens the window with
the settings of the sweep and the diagram. The sweep does not run the analysis itself and adds
nothing to its results. The diagram appears as soon as two speeds are done. The window can be
closed while the sweep runs: the block goes on and shows its progress.

#fields(
  [Speed range \[rpm\]], [The lowest and the highest speed of the diagram, shown in rad/s
    next to them. Default: from 0 to the speed of the centrifugal load, or to 10000 rpm when the
    analysis stands still. Standstill itself is not
    computed, as CalculiX merges the coinciding modes there; a range from 0 starts at a fiftieth
    of the highest speed.],
  [Maximum runs], [Number of CalculiX runs after which the sweep stops by itself (default 40);
    0 runs until #ui("Stop") is pressed.],
  [Engine orders], [The excitation lines $f = "order" times "speed"$ drawn into the diagram, as
    a comma-separated list such as `1, 2, 3`. They can be changed after the sweep.],
  [Frequency axis up to \[Hz\]], [Upper end of the frequency axis; 0 (default) fits the axis to
    the modes. A limit zooms in on the low frequencies, where the order lines of a stiff rotor
    run close to the speed axis. It can be changed at any time, also during the sweep.],
)

#ui("Start sweep") sets the centrifugal loads of the model to every speed, runs CalculiX in
a folder named after the block in that of the project in the work directory (@settings) and reads the complex frequencies of the
last Complex Frequency step and the whirl direction of every mode from the `.dat` file. When the
`.dat` file of a CalculiX version has no readable complex frequencies, they come from the `.frd`
file, without whirl directions. As many speeds run at the same time as #ui("Parallel analyses") of
the solver settings allows. The files of a speed are deleted once its frequencies are read; those
of a failed speed stay for a look.

The sweep needs no step size. It starts with eight speeds spread evenly over the range and then
keeps adding speeds where the curves bend most: between the two speeds whose curves deviate most
from a straight line, weighted with the width of the gap, so that a resolved curve lets the
speeds spread over the rest of the range. The diagram grows with every speed. The sweep ends at
#ui("Maximum runs"), at #ui("Stop"), which cancels the running speeds and keeps the finished ones,
or when no gap is wider than a five-hundredth of the range. #ui("Pause") lets the running speeds
finish and starts no new ones; #ui("Continue") goes on from there. #ui("Continue") also goes on
with a finished or stopped sweep: another #ui("Maximum runs") runs that refine between its speeds,
as long as the model has not changed since; after a change, #ui("Start sweep") begins anew.

To look closer at part of the diagram, hold #key("Shift") and drag across it: the marked speed
range is shaded and named #ui("Refine range"), and new speeds go only there, down to a
five-hundredth of the marked range. Mark a range while the sweep runs or is paused, or after it
finished, and press #ui("Continue"); the sweep again picks the speeds where the curves bend most
within the range. #ui("Clear range") under the diagram lets new speeds go anywhere again. Gaps next to a speed CalculiX could
not solve are not refined further. The progress and the messages of the runs appear below the
diagram. When fewer than two speeds give complex frequencies, the window says so in place of the
diagram; the messages below name the CalculiX error of each failed speed.

The diagram has one curve per mode and one dashed grey line per engine order, which starts at
0 rpm even though the sweep leaves out standstill. The modes are followed from speed to speed by
their course, not by their rank among the frequencies: a mode joins the curve it continues best,
so curves that cross keep their colour, and a curve that falls to zero and rises again (in the
rotating frame of reference, the forward whirl at its critical speed) stays one curve. Roots
CalculiX finds at fewer than three neighbouring speeds, such as a spurious root near 0 Hz, are
drawn as grey crosses named #ui("Unmatched roots") instead of tearing the curves; growing modes,
whose eigenvalue has an imaginary part of weight, are drawn as red diamonds named
#ui("Unstable"). A mode that whirls the same way at every speed carries its direction in the
legend, F (forward) or B (backward) as CalculiX reports it.

The diagram can be moved and zoomed like the plots of egui: drag it to pan, scroll to zoom,
drag along an axis to zoom only that axis, and double-click to fit the view to the curves again.
A click on a legend entry hides or shows that mode or order line. Hovering a point shows its
curve, speed and frequency.

#screenshot("campbell.png", [Campbell diagram of a spinning cantilever: an adaptive sweep, then a
marked range around the zero crossing of Mode 1 refined with Continue; Mode 7 is hidden by a
click on its legend entry])

Where a mode crosses an order line, the rotor is
excited at one of its eigenfrequencies: these crossings are listed under #ui("Critical speeds")
with the order, the mode, its whirl, the speed in rpm and the frequency. #ui("Copy table")
copies the frequencies of all modes at all speeds as tab-separated text. #ui("Export CSV ...")
saves the same table as a CSV file, with a Save As dialog: one row per speed with the speed in
rad/s and rpm, the frequency in Hz and the whirl (F, B or empty) of every curve, the other roots
CalculiX found at that speed (unmatched and unstable, separated by spaces), and the frequency of
every order line. Numbers use a decimal point and the cells are separated by commas.

#note[CalculiX solves the Coriolis modes in the rotating frame of reference. The frequencies of
the diagram are therefore those an observer rotating with the shaft would see, and a pair of
bending modes splits into a rising and a falling branch with the speed.]
