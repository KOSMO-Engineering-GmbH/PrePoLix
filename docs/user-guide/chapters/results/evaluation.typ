== Transformations <transformations>

The transformation button on the results toolbar shows the results of a symmetric or periodic
model as the full structure. Transformations only change the display.

#figure(
  grid(
    columns: (40%, 60%),
    gutter: 8pt,
    image("../../images/transformation.png"), image("../../images/symmetry.png"),
  ),
  caption: [Symmetry about the YZ plane and its result],
)

Move a type from #ui("Available") to #ui("Active") and set its properties:

/ Symmetry X/Y/Z: mirrors the model at the plane normal to the axis through the #ui("Symmetry
  point").
/ Linear pattern: copies the model #ui("Number of items") times along the line from the start to
  the end point.
/ Circular pattern: copies the model #ui("Number of items") times by #ui("Angle") about the axis
  through two points.

Several transformations are applied one after the other. Vector and tensor results are mirrored
or rotated with the copies, and legend and labels include them. #ui("Clear") removes all
transformations.

== Derived field outputs <derived-fields>

#ui("Create ...") on #ui("Field Outputs") computes new fields from the results.

#screenshot("field-output.png", [Create Field Output])

#fields(
  [Limit], [Divides a component by a limit value per part, per element set or for all elements.
    Gives `RATIO` (value / limit) and `SAFETY_FACTOR` (limit / value).],
  [Envelope], [`MAX`, `MIN` and `AVERAGE` of a component over all increments of all steps.],
  [Equation], [A formula of components, for example `=Abs([STRESS.S11]) / 235`, with the
    functions of PrePoMax (`Abs`, `Sqrt`, `Max`, `Min`, `Pow`, `Sin`, `If`, ...). #ui("Insert
    Component...") inserts a component name. #ui("Unit") is shown in the legend.],
  [Coordinate System Transformation], [Rotates a vector or tensor field into a coordinate system
    defined under #ui("Features"); cylindrical systems give radial, tangential and axial
    components.],
)

#limitation[Derived field outputs are lost when the result file is reloaded.]

== History outputs and tables <history-outputs>

#ui("History Outputs") on the #ui("Results") tab lists the history outputs from the `.dat` file
(for example the eigenfrequencies of a frequency step) and the ones you create with
#ui("Create ..."):

/ From Field Output: values of a field at selected nodes, one row per increment.
/ From History Output by Equation: a formula of other history outputs.
/ From Element Size: volume of elements or area of faces in every increment.

A double-click on a component opens its table. Click column headers to select them
(#key("Ctrl") adds, #key("Shift") selects a range) or drag over cells. #ui("Copy")
(#key("Ctrl+C")) copies the selection as tab-separated text, #ui("Plot") (#key("Ctrl+P")) draws
the selected columns over the first one.

#screenshot("history-table.png", [Eigenfrequencies from the `.dat` file])

#ui("Show in View") in the plot window puts the plot into the 3D view as an annotation, like a
path plot (see @paths): it stays after the window is closed and appears in screenshots. Drag the box
to move it and its bottom right corner to resize it. #ui("Edit...") in its context menu, or a
double-click, opens #ui("Edit Annotation") for the title, the axis labels and a fixed value range;
#ui("Delete"), or #ui("Remove from View") in the plot window, removes it. The plot keeps the values
it was made from; with results bound to a project (@bind-result) it is saved with them.

#screenshot("table-plot-in-view.png", [Displacements of two nodes over time, plotted from their
  table and shown in the 3D view])

== Paths <paths>

#ui("Create ...") on #ui("Paths") shows the displayed component along a straight line.

#screenshot("path.png", [Stress along a path through the hole])

#fields(
  [Start, End], [Coordinates (typed or picked with #ui("...")) or reference points.],
  [Points], [Number of points along the path (default 100).],
)

The dialog shows minimum, maximum and a plot of the value over the distance. #ui("Copy to
Clipboard") and #ui("Save as CSV...") export the values; #ui("Table") lists them. Points outside
the mesh have no value. The dialog's height can be changed by dragging its bottom right corner; the
plot takes the extra height.

#ui("Show in View") puts the plot into the 3D view as an annotation, where it stays after the
dialog is closed and appears in screenshots. It shows the displayed component of the current
increment and follows when another one is selected. Drag the box to move it and its bottom right
corner to resize it; #ui("Delete") in its context menu, or #ui("Remove from View") in the dialog,
removes it.

#screenshot("path-plot-in-view.png", [A path plot as an annotation in the 3D view])

#ui("Show on Path") in the context menu draws the plot onto the path itself instead: the path is
the distance axis, the values stand off it perpendicular on the screen over a translucent area,
with the largest and smallest value labelled. Drag the curve away from the path or towards it to
change its height; #ui("Show in Box") puts it back into its box.

#screenshot("path-plot-on-path.png", [The same plot drawn onto its path])

#ui("Edit...") in the context menu, or a double-click on the plot, opens #ui("Edit Annotation").
Changes show at once; #ui("Cancel") restores the plot.

#screenshot("path-plot-edit.png", [Editing a path plot])

#fields(
  [Display], [#ui("In Box") or #ui("On Path").],
  [Height on path], [Distance of the largest value from the path, in screen pixels.],
  [Title], [Empty for the path's name and the displayed component.],
  [Distance axis label, Value axis label], [Labels of the box's axes; the value axis label is
    written above the axis, empty for none.],
  [Value range], [#ui("Automatic") fits the axis to the values; otherwise #ui("Minimum") and
    #ui("Maximum") fix it, e.g. to compare increments. On the path, the larger end is drawn at
    the height.],
)

== Plane results

#ui("Create ...") on #ui("Plane Results") evaluates the displayed component on a plane defined
under #ui("Features"): minimum and maximum with their position, the area-weighted mean, and the
cut area. With its check box ticked, the 3D view shows only the cut, and the legend uses the
values on it.

== Hot spot stresses <hot-spots>

Hot spot stresses evaluate welded joints as recommended by the IIW: the stress at the weld toe is
extrapolated from read-out points on the plate surface. Double-click #ui("Hot Spot Stresses") in
the Results tree, or use #menu("Results", "Create Hot Spot ..."), and pick the weld toe.

#screenshot("hot-spot.png", [Create Hot Spot with the stress along the path, the read-out points
  and the extrapolation to the weld toe])

#fields(
  [Weld toe], [A node at the weld toe. An edge can be picked as well: of its nodes, the one with
    the highest hot spot stress in the displayed increment is evaluated and plotted.],
  [Extrapolation], [IIW type a, fine mesh, linear (0.4t / 1.0t, default) or quadratic
    (0.4t / 0.9t / 1.4t); type a, coarse mesh (0.5t / 1.5t); type b, fine (4 / 8 / 12 mm) or
    coarse (5 / 15 mm); or #ui("Custom read-out points").],
  [Plate thickness t], [For type a methods.],
  [Read-out points], [Shows the extrapolation formula.],
  [Stress], [#ui("Perpendicular to weld toe"), #ui("Max principal stress") or #ui("Signed max
    abs principal stress").],
  [Path direction], [Points away from the weld toe; PrePoLix turns it into the plate surface.
    #ui("Flip") reverses it.],
)

Below the inputs the dialog shows the result for the displayed increment while you edit: the hot
spot stress `S_hs` with its node, the stresses at the read-out points and a plot of the stress
along the path from the toe to a quarter beyond the last read-out point. The read-out points and
the hot spot stress are blue dots, the extrapolation through them is dashed, so you can check at a
glance whether the read-out points lie on the smooth part of the stress rise. The value axis
leaves out a sharp notch peak right at the toe, which would otherwise flatten the plot; hover the
curve to read values. #ui("Copy to Clipboard") and #ui("Save as CSV...") export the curve, the
read-out points and the hot spot stress.

#ui("Show in View") puts the plot into the 3D view as an annotation that stays after the dialog is
closed and follows the displayed increment, like the plot of a path (@paths): drag it to move it,
drag its corner to resize it. Its context menu offers #ui("Edit..."), #ui("Show on Path"), which
draws the curve, the read-out points and the extrapolation onto the path in the model, and
#ui("Delete").

#screenshot("hot-spot-on-path.png", [The plot of a hot spot shown on its path])

The evaluation runs for all increments and writes `<result>_hot_spots.csv` next to the result
file, with one row per toe node and increment; the output pane lists the highest value of each hot
spot. A hot spot is deleted with the #key("Del") key or #ui("Delete") in its context menu.

== Query <query>

#menu("Tools", "Query ...") or the #ui("Query") button of the toolbar (the pipette) reads values from the model by clicking: #ui("Vertex/Node"),
#ui("Facet/Element"), #ui("Edge") (length), #ui("Surface") (area), #ui("Part"), #ui("Assembly"), #ui("Bounding box size"), #ui("Distance")
(two nodes), #ui("Angle") (three nodes) and #ui("Circle") (centre and radius through three
nodes). The values appear in the output pane and as labels in the 3D view. On results, node
queries also show the deformed position, the displacement and the value of the displayed
component.

The labels stay in the view when the query window is closed, as in PrePoMax, and can be dragged
aside. A right click on a label offers #ui("Delete") for this label and #ui("Delete All
Annotations"); #ui("Remove Annotations") in the query window, in the #ui("Tools") menu and on the
toolbar deletes all of them. Each model keeps its own labels: the geometry, the FE model and every
result file. Meshing again removes those of the FE model, since they refer to node and element
ids.

#screenshot("query.png", [Querying nodes on a result])

#ui("Edge") and #ui("Surface") pick like the geometry based selection (@selection): an edge runs
from corner to corner, on the Geometry tab and on meshes generated from CAD geometry it is the CAD
edge; a surface is the CAD face or the smooth patch bounded by feature edges. Hovering shows what a
click would pick. On results the output pane also has the deformed length or area and the change.

  context menu of a label])
