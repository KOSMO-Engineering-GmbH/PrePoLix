= Running CalculiX <analysis>

== Solving an analysis

Each analysis of the project is solved in its window. CalculiX uses the settings under
#menu("Tools", "Settings ...", "CalculiX") (@settings) and runs in the folder
`<work directory>/<project name>/<analysis name>`, so the analyses of a project never overwrite
each other's files.

#screenshot("solve-toolbar.png", [Solve, Stop and Monitor in the toolbar of an analysis window,
  with the state of the solution])

#fields(
  [Solve (#key("F5"))], [Makes the analysis up to date, like #ui("Update") in Ansys
    Workbench: first it meshes the parts whose mesh is missing or out of date, then it runs
    CalculiX if the results are missing or out of date, and keeps the new results. If nothing
    changed since the last run, it only says so.],
  [Solve Again], [Runs CalculiX even if the results are up to date.],
  [Check Model], [Lets CalculiX only read and check the model (`*NO ANALYSIS`), without solving
    it.],
  [Stop], [Stops meshing for a solve, or the running CalculiX job.],
  [Monitor], [Shows the #ui("Analysis") tab of the output pane (@monitor).],
  [Open Results], [Opens the results the analysis keeps on the #ui("Results") tab.],
  [Remove Results], [Drops the results the analysis keeps (@bind-result).],
)

#ui("Solve"), #ui("Stop") and #ui("Monitor") are also in the toolbar, next to the state of the
solution; all commands are in the #ui("Analysis") menu. Which cells are out of date is decided
as in the project schematic (@project-window): changing a load makes only the solution out of
date, changing the meshing settings of a part makes its mesh out of date, and result paths or
planes change nothing that CalculiX needs.

The input file is named after the analysis, for example `Cantilever.inp`. Old result files of
the analysis in its folder are deleted before CalculiX starts. PrePoLix refuses to run a model
without mesh, without step or with all steps deactivated, and it stops if the input file cannot
be written (for example because a region is empty).

=== Monitor <monitor>

The monitor is the #ui("Analysis") tab of the output pane below the 3D view; it comes to the
front when a run starts, so the model and its results stay in view while CalculiX runs. Its
top row has #ui("Kill") to stop CalculiX, #ui("Results") to open the results once the run is
finished, the #ui("Filter") field and the status with the running time and the current step,
increment and iteration; below it is the output of CalculiX. The #ui("Output") tab goes back to
the messages, and the pane can be made taller by dragging its upper edge.

#screenshot("monitor.png", [The Analysis tab after a completed run])

The #ui("Filter") field shows only the lines that contain the text you type,
ignoring upper and lower case. With "average force", for example, you see the average force of
every increment one below the other. The filter applies while CalculiX is still running, and
#ui("Clear") or an empty field shows all lines again.

#screenshot("monitor-filter.png", [The Analysis tab showing only the lines with "cpu"])

The monitor keeps the last 20000 lines of a run, so a long run with many increments stays fast.
Once there are more, the oldest lines go and the top row tells how many, for example
#ui("10085 earlier lines not kept"); the new lines keep coming in at the bottom.

#screenshot("monitor-long-output.png", [The end of a long run, its first lines dropped])

The status at the end is #ui("completed"), #ui("finished with errors, results available"),
#ui("failed") or #ui("killed"). If CalculiX failed, PrePoLix looks for known error messages
in the output and adds a line "Possible cause: ..." with a remedy, for example for distorted
elements, missing material data, rigid body motion or missing convergence.

== Solving again from the last unchanged step <restart>

CalculiX can write the state of the model after each step over time (static, dynamic, heat
transfer, coupled and uncoupled temperature-displacement, visco) into a restart file, and
PrePoLix asks it to (`*RESTART, WRITE` in every such step). When you change a later step of an
analysis and solve again, CalculiX does not start from the beginning: it reads the state after
the last unchanged step from the earlier run and solves only the rest. The monitor tells which
of the two happened:

#fields(
  [Restart after step 2 of 3: ...], [The steps up to the second are unchanged; CalculiX reads
    their state and solves the third. The results and the history output of the earlier steps are
    joined with the new ones, so the results look as if all steps had been solved, and the input
    file kept with the results is the full one, which runs on its own.],
  [Full run: ...], [All steps are solved, with the reason: the model definition changed (a
    material, a section, the mesh, a new set for a load), the first step changed, there is no
    state of an earlier run, the states were written by another CalculiX, the restart files
    are turned off, or the step to continue from is not a step over time (a frequency, buckle
    or perturbation step leaves no state to continue from).],
)

A restart that CalculiX cannot finish is solved once more in full, so a changed analysis always
ends up solved. The state files stay in the folder of the analysis in the work directory, next
to its results; they are not saved in the project file, and after a move to another computer
the first run is a full one.

Under #menu("Tools", "Settings ...", "CalculiX") (@settings), #ui("Keep the state after each
step") turns the restart files off, and #ui("Restart files per project") limits the disk space
they take (4096 MB by default): beyond it, the oldest state files of the project are removed,
which only costs time, never correctness.

The same mechanism lets one analysis continue another one after a step, through a state link
in the project schematic (@state-links).

== Results kept with the project <bind-result>

When a run is finished, its analysis keeps the results: the input file, the result file
(`.frd`) and the history output (`.dat`) of the run are saved in the project file with the next
#menu("File", "Save Project"), together with a fingerprint of what the run was made from. The
results open on the #ui("Results") tab. The output pane shows how much the files add to the
project file; they are stored compressed, at about a third of their size (a 236 MB result file
adds about 100 MB). Keeping a large result takes a few seconds and runs in the background. A new
run replaces the results the analysis keeps.

When an analysis with kept results is opened, PrePoLix writes the files to `Kept_Results` in
the folder of the analysis and opens the results on the #ui("Results") tab. The project
schematic and the toolbar of the analysis window show whether they are still up to date.

What you defined on the kept results is saved with them and comes back as you left it: derived
field and history outputs, transformations, hot spots, the reference points, coordinate systems
and planes of the results, result paths and plane results, and the increment, field and component
shown. The view comes back too: the camera of the #ui("Results") tab, #menu("View", "Mesh Edges"),
the deformation and its factor, #ui("Show Undeformed"), the color levels, hidden parts, the
annotations of the query tool and the plots of result paths. PrePoLix takes all of this from the
open result each time the project is saved.

#screenshot("bound-result-restored.png", [Kept results reopened with their symmetry
  transformation and the component shown when the project was saved])

When the analysis runs again, its new results take over all of this from the results before, so the view, transformations, paths and plots stay as they
were. Annotations of the query tool and hot spots on picked nodes or faces refer to nodes and
elements of the mesh; they are kept only if the mesh did not change. After remeshing they are
dropped, reference points placed on picked nodes or faces stay at their last position, and the
output pane lists what was dropped.

#screenshot("rerun-keeps-view.png", [The results of a new run, shown from the front without mesh
  edges like the results before])

#menu("Analysis", "Remove Results") drops the kept results; save the project to remove them
from the file.

To send only the meshes and the model definitions, use
#menu("File", "Save Project Without Results ..."). It saves a copy without the kept results under
a new name (proposed as `<project name>-without-results.plx`); the open project stays on its own
file and keeps its results.

== Model check <model-check>

PrePoLix checks the model continuously while you work. Items with a problem get a warning sign in
the tree; items with an error and their containers are shown in red. Click the warning sign to see
what is wrong and how to fix it.

#screenshot("model-check.png", [Model check: parts without a section])

Errors include elements without material, materials without the data the step needs (elasticity,
density, conductivity, specific heat), invalid material constants, distorted elements, a missing
initial temperature in a transient heat transfer step, an increment larger than the step, rigid
body motion of a part in a static step, truss structures that are mechanisms, radiation without
the physical constants (@model-properties) and missing references (a deleted material, part or set that an item still uses). Warnings include parts held
only by contact (contact pairs without tied surface behavior; tied contact holds like a tie), conflicting boundary conditions, loads on fixed nodes, rotations without effect,
beam nodes with only some of their rotations given (CalculiX holds them all, and nonlinear steps
mostly fail to converge), beams held by pins only, which are free to turn about the line
through the pins (CalculiX solves them all the same), and steps without load.

#screenshot("beam-rotations-partly-held.png", [A beam end that holds only the rotation about Z])

When a run starts, PrePoLix also checks that the configured CalculiX knows every keyword of the
input file (see #ui("Test CalculiX") in @settings). An unknown keyword, for example of a step
type that an older CalculiX lacks, appears as error "Keyword unknown to CalculiX" on the
analysis and in the monitor, with the feature that needs it.

When CalculiX aborts, PrePoLix explains the error messages it knows in the same way, for
example "*RADIATE card was selected but no *PHYSICAL CONSTANTS card encountered" as "Physical
constants missing"; other messages appear as "CalculiX error" with the text of the monitor.

#screenshot("model-check-solver-error.png", [A CalculiX error explained after the run])

The checks do not stop a run; their errors are listed at the top of the monitor. Missing
references do stop it, because the input file cannot be written.

== Exporting the input file <export-inp>

#menu("File", "Export CalculiX Input File ...") writes the same input file as a run, for example
to run CalculiX by hand or on another computer. Deactivated items appear as comments.

== Submodels <submodel>

A submodel computes a detail of a larger model more precisely. Its cut boundaries follow the
displacements of the global model. Global model and submodel are two analyses of the project,
linked in the schematic (@results-links):

+ Set up the global model in one analysis and the submodel, with its own finer mesh, in
  another.
+ In the submodel, create a boundary condition of type #ui("Submodel") on the cut faces in a
  static step, and choose the displacement components.
+ Set #ui("Model Type") to #ui("Submodel") in the submodel's #ui("Model Properties"). Its block
  in the project schematic gets a #ui("Global results") row below #ui("State"), with an orange
  input pin and a question mark while nothing is linked.
+ Drag the results of the global step (the row of the step below #ui("Results") of the global
  analysis) to #ui("Global results"). The output pane confirms "takes the displacements of
  Step-1 of Global in Step-1 (submodel)", and the row names the global analysis. The step with
  submodel boundary conditions takes them, or the first step; the link also sets the global
  step of the boundary condition. Each step can take the results of another global step at its
  own #ui("Global results") input under #ui("Setup") > #ui("Steps"). Dropping results there
  makes an analysis a submodel too. Global results computed elsewhere come from a file block
  (@file-block) that reads their `.frd` file; its steps link the same way.

  #screenshot("submodel-global-results.png", [The results of Step-1 of the global analysis
    linked to the Global results row of the submodel])
+ #ui("Solve") the submodel or #ui("Update Project"): the global model is solved first if it has
  no results yet. PrePoLix copies the global results next to the input file and writes
  `*SUBMODEL` and `*BOUNDARY, SUBMODEL`.

In the #ui("Results") tab of the submodel, #ui("Show Global Contours") in the results tool bar,
next to #ui("Show Undeformed"), draws the edges of the global model around the results, read from
the global results the submodel took: at the global increment the submodel follows and deformed by
the same scale. They show where the submodel sits in the global model and how the two deform; the
global model is neither a part in the tree nor coloured, and the legend leaves its values out. The
switch shows only for a submodel whose global results file is there.

#screenshot("submodel-global-contours.png", [Results of a submodel at the clamped end of a beam,
  with the edges of the global model around it])

Removing the link leaves the analysis a submodel whose #ui("Global results") row waits for a new
one. #ui("Model Properties") makes it a general model again.

#limitation[Only displacements can be transferred. The global result file must not be the result
file of the submodel's own analysis.]

== Exporting a deformed mesh <export-deformed>

#menu("File", "Export Deformed Mesh (.inp) ...") writes the mesh of the displayed result with its
nodes moved by the displacements times the current deformation scale factor. A typical use is an
imperfection for a buckling analysis: show the buckling mode, set #ui("Deformation") to #ui("User
defined") with the imperfection amplitude as factor, export, and import the file into the model with
#ui("Import Geometry") (@mesh-import). The file contains only the mesh.
